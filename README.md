# Schedule

The scheduler text can download your class information from the Schedule Planner, and you can add the .ics file to any calendar you prefer. 

Here's how you can do it step by step. 
1. Open Schedule Planner from Calcentral and generate a schedule. 
2. Right click in the browser and inspect. 
3. Click Console (switch from Elements). 
4. Copy paste everything from scheduler.txt to Console and press return (enter). It should download a .ics file for you. 
5. If you use Apple Calendar, just click to open the .ics file, and it will automatically add to your calendar. If you use Google Calendar, click the plus sign "+" next to "Other calendars", click Import, and select the .ics file from your computer.
